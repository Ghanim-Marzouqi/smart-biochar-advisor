# Results and Discussion ✅

## Summary

- Four formulations (S1–S4) combining nano-biochar and NPK were prepared to evaluate how composition affects physical appearance and potential nutrient retention behavior.
- Increasing nano-biochar proportion led to darker, more carbon-dense mixtures with improved particle interaction and likely greater adsorption capacity.
- Increasing NPK (with fixed biochar) increased nutrient density and granularity, which may reduce adsorption and speed nutrient release.

## Formulations (overview)

| Sample | Nano-biochar (g) | NPK (g) | Description |
|--------|------------------:|--------:|-------------|
| S1     | 5                 | 5       | Baseline — light, uniform mixture |
| S2     | 10                | 10      | Balanced increase — denser, cohesive |
| S3     | 10                | 15      | Higher NPK — nutrient-rich, granular |
| S4     | 15                | 10      | Higher biochar — darker, carbon-dense |

## Per-sample observations 🧪

### Sample S1 — 5 g nano-biochar / 5 g NPK
- Appearance: Light-colored and uniform in texture.
- Notes: This baseline provides a reference for minimal material addition and allows comparison to higher-dosage formulations.

### Sample S2 — 10 g nano-biochar / 10 g NPK
- Appearance: Denser and more cohesive than S1.
- Notes: The equal increase in both components suggests improved interaction between carbon-based particles and mineral nutrients, creating a more integrated matrix.

### Sample S3 — 10 g nano-biochar / 15 g NPK
- Appearance: Visibly more granular and nutrient-rich compared to S2.
- Notes: Higher NPK load tests whether the fixed biochar quantity is sufficient for adsorption and stabilization; excess fertilizer may lead to reduced retention or faster release.

### Sample S4 — 15 g nano-biochar / 10 g NPK
- Appearance: Darker and more carbon-dense texture.
- Notes: Increased biochar proportion suggests higher surface area and adsorption potential, likely improving nutrient binding and reducing losses compared to lower-biochar samples.

## Interpretation and discussion

- A higher nano-biochar fraction increases carbon density, adsorption potential, and particle interaction, which can reduce nutrient losses and improve retention.
- Increasing only the fertilizer content (S3) increases nutrient density but may outpace the adsorption capacity of the biochar present, potentially causing faster nutrient release.
- Balancing carbon-based materials with mineral nutrients (as in S2) appears to create a cohesive mixture that can be tailored to specific performance outcomes (e.g., controlled nutrient release or soil conditioning).

## Implications and recommendations 💡

- For controlled nutrient release, prioritize increasing biochar content relative to fertilizer to take advantage of adsorption and retention.
- If immediate nutrient availability is required, higher NPK ratios (e.g., S3) may be appropriate but could increase leaching risk.
- Consider follow-up experiments to quantify nutrient release rates, adsorption isotherms, and soil interaction across these formulations.

## Next steps and further work 📈

1. Measure nutrient release kinetics (e.g., leaching or incubation tests) for S1–S4.
2. Assess adsorption capacity and retention behavior using standard isotherm methods.
3. Conduct greenhouse or small plot trials to evaluate plant response and long-term soil health effects.

If you'd like, I can also add figures or charts (e.g., bar charts for composition or photos of each sample), or prepare a table with physical metrics (bulk density, porosity) if you have the data. Would you like those included?
